> **Customize any song your way â€” isolate stems, fine-tune effects, and create your own unique sound.**

Sound Box is a web application that lets users upload or paste a link to a song, split it into stems (vocals, drums, bass, etc.), tweak audio effects like reverb (float input) and other integer-based controls like pitch, gain, and speed, then download a clean, customized track. Whether you're a casual listener or an aspiring producer, Sound Editor gives you full control over how you experience your music.

## Inspiration

We love music, and weâ€™ve always wanted a tool that made it easy to manipulate a song's individual parts â€” without needing a full DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Inspired by lofi remixes and AI-powered stem separation tools, we decided to create a fun, beautiful, and accessible audio editor for everyone.

---

## How We Built It

1. **Frontend**: Built with Vue 3 and styled with Tailwind CSS for clean, modern visuals.
2. **Stem Splitting**: Used LALAL.AIâ€™s API to handle professional-grade stem separation.
3. **Audio Effects**: Applied Pedalboard (by Spotify) to customize sound with pitch, reverb, gain, and more.
4. **Routing & State**: Vue Router manages page transitions and UX flow.
5. **Validation**: VeeValidate ensures correct input on sound effect forms.
6. **Audio Output**: Final audio is processed, served by FastAPI, and made downloadable via the frontend.

---

## Challenges We Faced

- Setting up cross-origin communication between frontend and backend on different systems (Mac vs. Windows).
- Managing real-time feedback while processing heavy audio tasks.
- Validating user inputs while keeping the UI intuitive.
- Making sure LALAL.AI API handled both uploads and YouTube inputs correctly.

---

## Accomplishments

- Fully working multi-step app with audio processing and final output.
- Designed a sleek UI from scratch with animated transitions and effects.
- Seamlessly integrated AI stem splitting and DSP effects into one flow.

---

## What We Learned

- How to connect a Vue frontend to a Python backend smoothly.
- Working with audio libraries and real-time media processing.
- Designing for both technical correctness and user experience.
- Handling async logic and loading states cleanly in the UI.

---

## What's Next

- Deploy the app so anyone can try it out!
- Possibly explore AI-powered suggestions for auto-effect presets
